# Introduction
Floods is one of the most significant natural disasters which often leads to loss of life and property. Therefore, correct and reliable flood forecasting and flood management is always an important task for flood hazard mitigation and to save materialistic and human resource of any nation. Saving lives of people by conducting rescue opearations are important and we need more optimised and perfect technical solution to help the victims. Technology is evolving at exponential rate but with this pace there is a question to human civilisation, Are we using this technology to save the mankind or not? We are using technology to help human civilisation to save lives of human beings.




# Application(app)
Our mobile application help the victims to find the safe and suitable place to dislocate. Given the current location of flood and population of nearby area and suitable place for them to safely landup and stay in camps upto the conditions becomes normal for survival.
We make our application user friendly which can provide boats, food packets and advise to deal with current problems during flood and how to save himself/herself and also how the app user can save others life. We are also working on buffers which will help the app user to investigate the behaviour of water flow during flood in nearby areas of the river and at what rate whater is approaching their village or town.

# Data usage and some predictions

We also implement Artificial Neural Network algorithm to predict the stream flow rate.At present, two main approaches are employed in flood forecasting. The first approach is based on physical modeling, which establishes the relationship between rainfall and runoff. However, it is difficult to develop a fully physically based forecasting model due to the complex nature of floods and the varied responses to them. The second approach is based on modeling statistical relationship between the hydrologic input and output. However, the relationship between rainfall and runoff is notoriously nonlinear during the storm events. Therefore, it is also difficult to construct a statistical model using conventional regression techniques.To provide an alternative approach for accurate flood forecasting, artificial neural network (ANN) has been suggested, which has the powerful capability to model nonlinear and complex systems without clear physical explanation.
